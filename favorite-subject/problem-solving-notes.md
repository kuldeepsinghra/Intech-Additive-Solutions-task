# Favorite Subject: Problem Solving

Problem Solving has always been my favorite subject in engineering and in software development. I enjoy breaking down complex problems into manageable parts and applying logical reasoning, algorithms, and data structures to find optimal solutions.

## Why I Love Problem Solving

- It improves logical thinking and creativity.
- Each problem is unique, which keeps me engaged and constantly learning.
- It sharpens algorithmic thinking which is essential for real-world software development.

## Example: Classic Problem I Solved

### Problem: String Compression
Given a string like `"aabcccccaaa"`, compress it using run-length encoding to become `"a2b1c5a3"`, and then further optimize it to `"ab1c5a3"` or similar.

I solved this in two stages:
1. **Run-Length Encoding** – count consecutive characters.
2. **Second-Level Compression** – remove unnecessary `"1"`s or merge repeating patterns.
3. **Decompression** – reconstruct original string.

### Skills Used:
- Iterative logic
- String manipulation
- Edge case analysis
- Clean, testable code design

## Other Problems I Enjoy:
- Trapping Rainwater
- Prime Number Algorithms
- Matrix Multiplication
- Linked List Operations (like finding middle node in one pass)
- Number Theory puzzles (e.g., sum of consecutive numbers)

## Real-Life Impact
This mindset helps me write clean backend logic, debug complex workflows, and build scalable systems with performance in mind.
